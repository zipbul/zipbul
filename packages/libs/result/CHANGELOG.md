## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 5744dc2: Remove `stack` property from `Err` type. Result pattern represents expected failures where stack traces are unnecessary — error data alone should describe the cause and origin. This aligns with how Rust's `Result` and Go's `error` handle expected failures.

  BREAKING CHANGE: `Err` no longer has a `stack` property. Access `err().stack` will be `undefined`.

## 0.1.4

- 55cf7d7: Include LICENSE file in published packages

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- f3f036f: fix(release): resolve workspace:\* protocol and restore GitHub release creation

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- afb893b: fix(release): use bun publish to correctly resolve workspace:\* protocol

  Previously `npx changeset publish` (npm publish) shipped `"workspace:*"` to npm
  as-is, making the package uninstallable for consumers. Switched to `bun publish`
  which natively resolves `workspace:*` to real version numbers at publish time.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- fec6633: refactor(shared): move HttpMethod type from enums/ to types/

  `HttpMethod` is a string literal union type, not an enum. Moved to `src/types/` to correctly reflect its nature. Public API is unchanged — still accessible via the main entry point.

  build: enable minification with --production flag across all packages

## 0.1.0

- 08bfee5: Add `safe()` function and `ResultAsync` type

  - `safe(promise)` / `safe(promise, mapErr)`: wraps Promises, catches rejections into `Err`
  - `ResultAsync<T, E>`: type alias for `Promise<Result<T, E>>`
